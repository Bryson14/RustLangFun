/// --- Part Two ---
/// To make things a little more interesting, the Elf introduces one additional rule. Now, J cards are jokers - wildcards that can act like whatever card would make the hand the strongest type possible.
///
/// To balance this, J cards are now the weakest individual cards, weaker even than 2. The other cards stay in the same order: A, K, Q, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, J.
///
/// J cards can pretend to be whatever card is best for the purpose of determining hand type; for example, QJJQ2 is now considered four of a kind. However, for the purpose of breaking ties between two hands of the same type, J is always treated as J, not the card it's pretending to be: JKKK2 is weaker than QQQQ2 because J is weaker than Q.
///
/// Now, the above example goes very differently:
/// ```
/// 32T3K 765
/// T55J5 684
/// KK677 28
/// KTJJT 220
/// QQQJA 483
/// ```
/// 32T3K is still the only one pair; it doesn't contain any jokers, so its strength doesn't increase.
/// KK677 is now the only two pair, making it the second-weakest hand.
/// T55J5, KTJJT, and QQQJA are now all four of a kind! T55J5 gets rank 3, QQQJA gets rank 4, and KTJJT gets rank 5.
/// With the new joker rule, the total winnings in this example are 5905.
///
/// Using the new joker rule, find the rank of every hand in your set. What are the new total winnings?
